	o	K = Kelloggs
	o	N = Nabisco
	o	P = Post

•	type:
	o	cold

Problems to solve:
1.	Find all unique values of columns: “name”, “mfr”, “vitamins” 
and store them in separate numpy arrays and print them.

2.	Create a new dataframe with all columns for which,
‘sodium’ is greater than 100 AND ‘protein’ is less than 3
	Name this dataframe:  df_HighSodLowProt
	Print this dataframe.

3.	From the dataframe in 2. print the average ‘calories’ by ‘mfr’  and also print the ‘mfr’ with the highest average ‘calories’.
